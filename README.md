# Double-KANs-Enhancing-KANs-with-Simplified-NURBS
This paper introduces NURBS into KANs to enhance their capability in approximating abrupt signals while maintaining full compatibility with existing KAN-based architectures for seamless integration.Experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms MLPs, vanilla KANs, and their variants.
